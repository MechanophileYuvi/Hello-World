# Hello-World
Hi, I am Yuvraj Singh Kumpavat. Friends call me Yuvi or maybe sometimes UV, since I love Sun. Huge fan of Wham! band and my favorite genre of music is 80s pop and soft rock. I love cars a lot.
If someone asks my what's your favorite brand for cars, I would say Subaru. They can literally tread anywhere. I got my own blog channel where I post a lot of stuffs about cars.
